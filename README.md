- My most recent achievement is that , in the span of 3 months, I had the pleasure to work with 4 colleagues from my University on a team project which consisted of us creating a website. Thus , we came up with the idea of 'Library of Peers' , a website where you can connect with people around your area and borrow/ lend books between each other. My main contribution to this project was in the frontend part , sign up page , edit profile page , add a book page and working on making the backend and frontend work together well. It was very exciting and , at the same time, challenging to learn JavaScript , CSS  and HTML from the ground up using the React framework.
